# Head First Design Patterns in ABAP

## Chapter 1 - Strategy

**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Design Principles

1 - Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

2 - Program to an interface, not an implementation

3 - Favor composition over inheritance

## Chapter 3 - Decorator

**The Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Design Principles

5 - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
